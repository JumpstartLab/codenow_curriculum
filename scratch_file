To Open Ruby:

1) Click the windows logo thingy
2) Where it says "Search Programs and Files"
   type this: cmd
3) It should find a little black box, click it
4) type this: irb
   hit <enter>
5) You'll get something like this:
   irb(main):001:0>
   
   
"Escape Hatch":
  Ctrl-C, then <enter>
  
Objects, Attributes, and Methods:

  What is a chair?
    Something you sit in
    Able to be sat on?
    Four legs? Five Legs?
    Back piece
    Flat part you sit on
    --
    The idea of "Chairness"
    What does it mean to be a chair?
      -- Some legs
      -- A back
      -- A seating area
      
  "Class" - An Abstract Idea
    What is the general shape of ALL
    things that fit in this group

  "Instance" - A Specific ONE of that Class
    An actual one we can look at,
    measure, use, etc  
  
  Writing a Class
    Name in "CamelCase": words are mashed
      together, with capitals for each word
    Starts with the word "class"
    Ends with the word "end"
  
  Creating an Instance of a Class
    You type: ClassName.new
    Or, to store it in a variable:
      variable_name = ClassName.new
  
  Asking an Instance Questions
    "What class are you?"
      variable.class
    "What do you know how to do?"
      variable.methods
      (Methods are things an object knows
       how to do)
  
  Writing Our Own Methods
    A "method" is something that an object 
    can do
    Write methods _inside_ a class
    So it'll look like this:
    
    class ClassName
      def method_name
        # do something
      end
    end
  
  For Example:
  
    class PersonalChef
      def make_toast
        puts "Making Your Toast"
      end
    end
  
  Finding Unique Methods
    I want to find all the things a PersonalChef
    knows how to do, that other objects DO NOT
  
    There is a class named Object
    We can create instances with Object.new
    
  Parameters - How you want it done
    Write a method to take a parameter like this:
      def make_toast(color)
        puts "Making your toast #{color}"
      end
  
  Method Chaining
    Executing methods one after another
    For instance:
      
      
      
      
  Return Value
    The result of an instruction/method
    In Ruby, every instruction returns a value
    
    For Example:
      class PersonalChef
        def make_toast(color)
          puts "Making your toast #{color}"
          return self
        end
      end
      
==== DAY 2 ====

START MENU
Type "Notepad" into the search
Click on Notepad
-- once it's open --
FILE => SAVE AS => day2.rb
Instead of "Text Document",
  Change it to "ALL FILES"

cd Documents
dir

Quick:
  Make a program that prints this:
  
  Today is the 3 day of the week,
  28 day of the month
  362 day of the year.
  
  Part 2: "Tell Lies"
    Tomorrow's day of the week
    Yesterday's day of the month
    Last Wednesday's day of the year
    
  Challenge:
    (delete your old program first)
    Ask "How many Hellos do you want?"
    Take in the number
    Print "Hello" that many times

===== Ardunio ====

1 ) Wire up a 1-LED circuit connected to pin 11
2 ) Write the program to turn on that LED
3 ) Make it work


You know you're in IRB if you see:

irb(main):001:0>

This is for experimenting with Ruby
=================
You know you're on the command prompt if you see:

C:\Users\codenow\Documents

This is for moving around the filesystem, or running files


-----------------

In NOTEPAD
  Click FILE => NEW
  Click FILE => SAVE AS
  Name it "decrypt.rb"
  Change to "ALL FILES"
  Click SAVE
  
  
-----------------

 Now...let's have ONE program that does this:
 
   ASK whether we want to ENCRYPT or DECRYPT
   ASK for the MESSAGE
   Give us the OUTPUT
