## Day 1

Went Well:
  - Morning Ruby instruction was fair
  - Exercises were solid, but a little disorganized
  
Went Poorly:
  - Disappointed to do all the logistical setup this morning
  - Whole arduino segment was mess
  - Arduino Software
  - Camera / Lighting sucked
  - I was frustrated talking over people
  
Causes:
  - JC did bad communicating about plans (arduino HW, arduino SW)
  - JC didn't set good protocols for helping

Changes:
  - Need a lamp
  - Need to clarify how/when to help (volume)
  - Better day-before setup
  - Printed plans for Arduino
  - Sketched exercises for Ruby
  
Next Steps:
  - Get lamp
  - Talk about how to help
  - Writeup sketches for Arduino & print
  - Writeup exercises for Ruby & print
  - Run test sketches on each laptop
